Installation
============

Unittesting
-------------

In this package, we provide unittesting and regression testing. For 
unittesting exectute following command:

$nosetests phasesymtests.py

Regression Testing
--------------------

To carry out regression tests, you need matfiles with set of parameters
used on original matlab code of Dr. Peter Kovesi. Obtain his code from his
website. test_phasesym.m file is provided to generate testing files in matlab
to carry out regression testing. To generate test matfiles, open a matlab 
terminal (change to appropriate directory) and then execute following command 
on matlab prompt:

$ >> test_phasesym(n)

where n is number of iterations tests you want to carry out. The test_phasesym.m 
file selects the parameters at random for a given range of parameters for 
original phasesym code and writes matfiles. Store all the matlfiles in folder
matfiles/ directory of pyphasesym. Some example test matfiles are provided with
the package
